The following steps must be taken to build the package:

# install and setup rpmbuild system
yum install rpm-build
python setup.py bdist_rpm

# install epel repository
yum install epel-release

# install pip
yum install python-pip

# upgrade pip to latest version
pip install --upgrade pip

# install pyinstaller
pip install pyinstaller==2.1

# create rpmbuild directories
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros

# edit the file /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PyInstaller/utils/misc.py 
# and put a "return None" line in the check_not_running_as_root function.
# otherwise pyinstaller will not start as root

# some more dependencies must be installed
yum install python-cb-integration python-dateutil python-pika

# you can now build the rpm package with
python setup.py bdist_binaryrpm

# the rpm is in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64

#python-cb-integration python-pika
